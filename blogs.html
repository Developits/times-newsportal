          Qustion:01) Var, Let, and Const – What's the Difference?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong class="text-danger">Answer:</strong>
          In the early days of JavaScript, there was only one way to declare
          variables and that was using the var keyword. However, there were some
          issues associated with variables declared using the var keyword so it
          was necessary to evolve new ways for variable declaration. With the
          advent of ES6, now developers are able to define variables according
          to their specific needs, thanks to two new keywords: let and const.
          All three of these three keywords have similarities in their syntax
          for declaring variables. However, they differ in their usage and
          scope, as detailed in the next section. The differences between var,
          let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include: Variables
          declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
          Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means
          that the variable can be accessed in their enclosing scope even before
          they are declared. Variables declared with the let keyword are
          block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to the
          immediate enclosing block. Let us now discuss, in detail, how these
          keywords can make a developer’s code more efficient and how to use
          each keyword to declare variables in JavaScript programs. The var
          keyword has traditional variable declaration syntax. It is optional to
          initialize a variable with a value if it is declared with the var
          keyword. If developers do not initialize it with a value, JavaScript
          will automatically assign undefined to it.

        <h3>What is difference between map,forEach,find and Filter?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong class="text-danger">Answer:</strong>
          Foreach The easy one right ? we all know why this method is used for
          and even you don’t know about this method the name pretty much
          explains everything. Foreach takes a callback function and run that
          callback function on each element of array one by one. Filter Whenever
          you have to filter an array Javascript inbuilt method to filter your
          array is the right choice to use. Filter let you provide a callback
          for every element and returns a filtered array. The main difference
          between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array
          and executes the callback but filter executes the callback and check
          its return value. If the value is true element remains in the
          resulting array but if the return value is false the element will be
          removed for the resulting array.Map One of my favourite and most used
          array method of all time. As a ReactJS developer I use map a lot
          inside my application UI. Map like filter & foreach takes a callback
          and run it against every element on the array but whats makes it
          unique is it generate a new array based on your existing array.As the
          name already suggest reduce method of the array object is used to
          reduce the array to one single value.

          What is the difference between arrow function and regular function?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong class="text-danger">Answer:</strong>
          Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature
          introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function
          expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow
          functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences
          between them.The arrow function example above allows a developer to
          accomplish the same result with fewer lines of code and approximately
          half the typing.Arrow functions do not have an arguments binding.
          However, they have access to the arguments object of the closest
          non-arrow parent function. Named and rest parameters are heavily
          relied upon to capture the arguments passed to arrow functions.Unlike
          regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this. The
          value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the
          lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in
          the closest non-arrow parent function.Regular functions created using
          function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable.
          Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using
          the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and
          not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as
          constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new
          keyword.Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters,
          whether in strict or non-strict mode.
